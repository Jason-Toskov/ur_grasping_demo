Some useful links/notes for ros and python:

- [setup.py for ros packages](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/catkin/html/user_guide/setup_dot_py.html)
- [Might need this?](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/How-To-Guides/Using-Python-Packages.html)
- For the catkin-run setup.py to play nice, python files need to end in .py, not have no extension and rely on the shebang line. If the extension isn't included in the filename, it seems to be missed by setup.py.
